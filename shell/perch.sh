# perch shell integration (bash/zsh)
#
# Wraps the `perch` binary so that worktree create / switch operations
# `cd` the parent shell into the target directory. The binary prints the
# target path on stdout only when a `cd` hand-off is wanted; everything else
# (prompts, status, errors) is written to stderr.
#
# Source from your shell rc:
#   source ~/.config/perch/perch.sh
#
# `br` and `wt` are defined alongside `perch` as shorthand for `perch br` and
# `perch wt`. Set PERCH_NO_SHORTCUTS to any non-empty value before sourcing to
# leave both names alone — broot defines its own `br`, and only one can win:
#   PERCH_NO_SHORTCUTS=1
#   source ~/.config/perch/perch.sh
#
# Behaviour:
#   - empty stdout              → nothing to do
#   - single-line existing dir  → cd there
#   - anything else             → print stdout through unchanged

  # zsh completions are claimed by name at compinit time, so `_perch` cannot ask

  # It needs compinit to have run already; sourced earlier than that, the guard
  # skips it and `br`/`wt` go uncompleted rather than erroring out of your rc.
